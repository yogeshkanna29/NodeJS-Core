# NodeJS Architecture and Components

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside the browser. It can make console-based and web-based Node.js applications.

- It is asynchronous, enabling efficient handling of concurrent requests.
- Developers can create event-driven applications using callbacks and event emitters.
- npm (Node Package Manager) provides access to thousands of reusable packages.
- Node.js runs on a single thread. Despite being asynchronous, it uses an event loop to handle requests.

<strong>Request -> Event Queue -> Event Loop -> Using Thread Pool -> Blocking Operations(External Resources), Non-Blocking Operations(I/O Polling).</strong>

> Node.js follows a single-threaded event loop model that handles all client requests using a single thread. It is based on a non-blocking I/O model, meaning the server can process multiple requests without waiting for one task to complete before starting the next.

- Event Loop: The event loop processes tasks without blocking, allowing Node.js to handle many requests concurrently on a single thread.
- Asynchronous Execution: Non-blocking functions are used for tasks such as reading from the file system or querying databases. This ensures the application remains responsive.

    <summary><strong>Components of Node.js Architecture</strong></summary>

> Node.js architecture consists of components that work together to handle asynchronous, non-blocking operations efficiently.

- V8 Engine: Compiles JavaScript to machine code for fast execution.
- Event Loop: Manages asynchronous tasks without blocking the main thread.
- Libuv: Handles I/O operations, thread pool, and timers.
- Non-Blocking I/O: Executes tasks without waiting for previous ones to complete.

1. Modules in Node.js
> Node.js is based on modules, which are reusable pieces of code that can be imported into applications. These include built-in modules (like fs and http) and external packages installed using NPM.

2. Event Loop and Asynchronous Programming
> Node.js uses an event loop to handle asynchronous tasks without blocking execution, making applications fast and responsive.
> - Runs tasks in the background (non-blocking I/O).
> - Uses callbacks when tasks complete.
> - Handles multiple requests efficiently.
