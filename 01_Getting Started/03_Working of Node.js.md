# Working of Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser for server-side development. It provides access to system-level features such as the file system.

- Uses an asynchronous and non-blocking architecture.
- Handles multiple requests efficiently with minimal resource usage.
- Commonly used for building APIs, chat applications, and streaming services.
- NPM (Node Package Manager) is a tool that comes with Node.js and is used to manage project dependencies and configurations.

    <summary><strong>Node.js Request Handling Process</strong></summary>

> Node.js handles client requests using an event-driven architecture with the Event Loop and Thread Pool to ensure efficient and scalable performance.

- The client sends a request to the Node.js web server.
- The request can be blocking (synchronous) or non-blocking (asynchronous).
- Node.js receives the request and places it in the Event Queue.
- The Event Loop continuously checks the queue and processes requests in FIFO (First In, First Out) order.

    <summary><strong>Request Processing</strong></summary>
    
> Requests are handled differently based on whether they are blocking or non-blocking.

- If the request is non-blocking, it is processed immediately and the response is sent back to the client.
- If the request is blocking, it is sent to the Thread Pool.

> Note : Node.js is often described as single-threaded, but this is only partially true. While it uses a single main thread to execute your JavaScript code, the runtime as a whole is multi-threaded behind the scenes to handle background tasks

<details>
    <summary><strong>Thread Pool Handling</strong></summary>
    
> Manages blocking tasks in a web application by assigning them to available threads for execution.

- The Thread Pool contains a limited number of threads.
- If a thread is available, the blocking task is assigned to it.
- Once completed, the result is returned to the Event Loop, which sends the response to the client.
- If all threads are busy, new blocking requests must wait in a queue.

> Note: A thread is like a worker that processes blocking tasks so the main application can continue running smoothly.

    <summary><strong>Blocking or Synchronous Operation</strong></summary>
    
> In a blocking or synchronous operation, tasks are executed one after another, and the program waits for each task to complete before moving to the next.

- Tasks are executed in a fixed sequence.
- The program waits until the current task is finished.
- Time-consuming operations can delay the entire program.
- Simple to understand but less efficient for multiple requests.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Non-Blocking or Asynchronous Operation</strong></summary>
    
> In a non-blocking or asynchronous operation, tasks are executed without waiting for previous ones to complete, allowing efficient handling of multiple operations.

- Tasks run in the background without blocking execution.
- Improves performance by handling multiple operations simultaneously.
- Uses callbacks or promises to handle results after completion.
