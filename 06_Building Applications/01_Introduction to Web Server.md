# Introduction to Web Server

System that stores and delivers web content to users over the internet is known as a web server, which primarily uses HTTP or HTTPS protocols. An HTTP server specifically focuses on handling HTTP requests and responses between the client and the server.

- Responds to browser requests by serving web resources.
- HTTP server is a type of web server focused on HTTP communication.
- Some web servers support additional protocols beyond HTTP.

When a user enters a URL, the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, which processes it and returns the required resources to display the page.

- Client Request: In the web browser (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), the user enters a URL.
DNS Resolution: The browser contacts a DNS server to obtain the IP address of the requested domain.
- Establishing Connection: Using the obtained IP address, the browser establishes a connection with the web server through TCP (and TLS in case of HTTPS).
- Sending HTTP Request: The browser sends an HTTP request (with headers and method like GET/POST) to the server.
- Processing Request: The web server receives the request, processes it, and may interact with backend services or databases.
- Serving the Response: The server sends back a response containing status codes and requested files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).
- Rendering the Web Page: Based on the received data, the browser parses, executes scripts, and displays the web page to the user.
